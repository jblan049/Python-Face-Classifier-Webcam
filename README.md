# Python-Face-Classifier-Webcam
Simple facial recognition using the default OpenCV cascade. The application reads in frames from an attached webcam, changes the frame from color to grayscale, and then applies the Haar Cascade to determine the number of faces inside of each frame. The frame is then printed to the end-user with bounding boxes drawn around each face.
